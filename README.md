# aircrat-sos-communication
Python-based simulation model developed as part of a Master’s thesis at Linköping University, Sweden. The project investigates inter-aircraft communication and decentralized weather avoidance from a System-of-Systems perspective, using corridor-based routing and peer-to-peer information sharing to assess operational efficiency and safety impacts.
